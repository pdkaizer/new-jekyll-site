This morning as my wife and I came out of our local Starbucks and headed to our cars I noticed a bumper sticker on the car parked next to me. I am a firm believer in agreeing to disagree, particularly when it comes to politics, but in my opinion, this crosses the line of civility. It brought to mind an <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124459588">NPR story</a> I heard just the other day about the current governor of Florida, who is running for the U.S. Senate. I suspect I would not agree with Governor Crist's positions on most issues, but he had it right in terms of respecting your opponent.  The offending bumper sticker, on the other hand, does nothing to further anyone's cause, it only creates a disturbing experience.  I think people should be more mindful of the experiences they are creating for others by their actions and even their thoughts and words.
